# Stack
### Data Structures

Need a contributor to complete this documentation

A stack is a linear data structure in which an element may be inserted or deleted only at one end, called the top of the stack.
Stacks are sometimes known as LIFO (last in, first out) lists.A stack can be accessed only at one of its ends for storing and retrieving data.
There are two ways of implementing a stack : Array (Static) and linked list (dynamic).
Such a stack resembles a stack of trays in a criteria: new trays are put on the top of the stack and taken off the top.
