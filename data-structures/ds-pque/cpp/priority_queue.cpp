//The queue which is implemented as FIFO where insertions are done at one end (rear) and deletions are done from another end (front). The first element that entered is deleted first.

Queue operations are

EnQueue (int data): Insertion at rear end

int DeQueue(): Deletion from front end

But a priority queue doesnâ€™t follow First-In-First-Out, but rather than each element has a priority based on the basis of urgency.

Items with the same priority are processed on First-In-First-Out service basis.

An item with higher priority is processed before other items with lower priority.//
