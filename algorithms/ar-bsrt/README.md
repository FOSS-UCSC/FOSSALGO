# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Introduction

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements are compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

The below image illustrates a simple explanation of how the Bubble Sort Algorithm works. To learn more about Bubble Sort Algorithm refer to the below-mentioned link.
