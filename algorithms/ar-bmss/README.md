# Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm

## Introduction

the Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark for
practical string-search literature. Boyer-Moore- is an algorithm for finding substrings into strings. This
algorithm compares each character of substring to find a word or the same characters into the string. When characters
do not match, the search jumps to the next matching position in the pattern by the value indicated in the Bad Match
Table
