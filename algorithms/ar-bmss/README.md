# Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm

## Introduction

The Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm is an efficient string-searching
algorithm that is the standard benchmark for practical string-search
literature. Boyer-Moore is an algorithm for finding substrings into
strings. This algorithm compares each character of substring to find a
word or the same characters into the string. When characters do not match,
the search jumps to the next matching position in the pattern by the
value indicated in the Bad Match Table.
