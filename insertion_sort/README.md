# Insertion Sort
### Algorithms

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
It will pick one element at a time and insert it in the correct position before it.
And can be represented by the following algorithm.

	1. Insert data into an array of n elements
	2. Loop from i=1 to i= n-1
		a. Pick the 'i'th element and insert it into the sorted sequence
		from '1'st element to the 'i-1'th element.

More information on the algorithm can be obtained by following the link below.
